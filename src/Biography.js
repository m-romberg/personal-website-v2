      I'm a full-stack developer in <b>Los Angeles, California</b> with a passion for
      contributing to revolutionary ideas and building meaningful projects.
      After completing two degrees at UCLA and a full stack web development
      program, I am currently seeking work as a software engineer.

      Most recently, I collaborated with peers to launch an expanded
      version two of Numbers API. Unmaintained for years with outdated,
      undocumented code, we rebuiltthis application with modern tools,
      switching from an Express.js backend to a Flask supported app.

      Throughout my time as a researcher in both chemistry and history,
      I constantly leveraged the power of code to discover, clean, and convey
      never-before-seen information that led to tangible impacts. Previously,
      I was an atmospheric chemist at <b>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b>,
      supporting the development of a <b>chemical reanalysis model </b>
       to be used by public health officials regarding air quality standards.
      Additionally, I had a project commissioned with the <b>Los Angeles Public
      Library's Special Collections</b> to build a digital database that improved
      accessibility and increased user traffick. Programming enabled me to
      engage in two vastly different sectors and effective to make change in
      both. Now, I'm a full time programmer.
