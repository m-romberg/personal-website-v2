      Throughout my time as a researcher in both chemistry and history,
      I constantly leveraged the power of code to discover, clean, and convey
      never-before-seen information that led to tangible impacts. Previously,
      I was an atmospheric chemist at <b>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b>,
      supporting the development of a <b>chemical reanalysis model</b>
      to be used bypublic health officials regarding air quality standards.
      Additionally, I had a project commissioned with the <b>Los Angeles Public
      Library's Special Collections</b> to build a digital database that improved
      accessibility and increased user traffick. Programming enabled me to
      engage in two vastly different sectors and effective to make change in
      both. Now, I'm a full time programmer.
